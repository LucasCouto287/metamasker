This is a school project for Blockchain Development at George Brown College. I know... MetaMasker is a bad name. Didn't bother to come up with one that makes more sense.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Guide`
You have to have installed MetaMask and have an account to use it. Although you can test what happens if you don't with incognito

After connecting with MetaMask you will notice that the app has 3 main features:
  1. Crypto Tracker
  2. Wallet Manager
  3. Transactions
 
#### `Crypto Tracker`
You can track cryptocurrencies here. There is the option to add additional crypto and fiat currencies to make further comparisons. Also by clicking the "live" button the data will refresh every 5s.

#### `Wallet Manager`
Here you can add as many wallets as you want. All you need is a valid private key. Press the "+" button and fill in the fields to create a wallet.

#### `Transactions`
To use this you have to have at least one wallet created. Afterwards you can select the wallet you want to use, and then fill out the fields for the target address and the amount. Then press the "send" button to send some Ether.
